# React App

This React App is designed for the Rocket Elevators customers, so that they can see the interventions on their buildings. They can also make a new intervention. 

There's 3 pages. The first page is the login page `localhost:3000/login`, where the customer can authenticate himself. The second page is the home page `localhost:3000/home` where that customer can see the interventions that concerns him and the third one is called form `localhost:3000/form`. It is where the customer can make an intervention.

This week was really hard for me. I had trouble to understand the concepts, etc. 
I cleared my scheduled for the entire bootcamp, except for this weekend. I will play music for a Christmas show at my church. I have a leading role, so there's some people that counts on me for our 10 representations. I thought that I would be ok because it's not during the week, but it's the first week I'm not able to finish my project. So my video shows where I'm at, and I'm deeply sorry that it's not the same quality then usual. If I had had more time, I could've done it.
